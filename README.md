Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice in which code changes are regularly built, tested, and validated after being merged into a shared repository. The goal of CI is to prevent integration problems,  ensuring the codebase is always in a deployable state, and provide rapid feedback to developers. 
Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which code changes from the repository are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. The goal of CD is to ensure that new code changes can be safely and quickly released to users and prevent problems such as overloading operations teams with manual processes which slow down app delivery.
CI/CD offers ongoing automation and continuous monitoring throughout the whole software development lifetime, from the integration and testing phase to delivery and deployment. Development and operations terms collaborate in an agile manger using either a DevOps or site reliability engineering methodology, and these interconnected processes are collectively referred to as a” CI/CD pipeline”

Some popular tools for implementing CI/CD include:

Jenkins: An open-source automation server that can be used to automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code changes.
CircleCI: A cloud-based CI/CD platform that provides an easy-to-use interface which allows automation across the user’s pipeline, from code building, testing to deployment. 
Travis CI: A cloud-based CI/CD platform that is popular among open-source projects and is easy to set up and use.
GitLab: A CI/CD platform that is built into the GitLab code repository and issue tracking platform.

Using a CI/CD tool can help to streamline the development process by automating repetitive tasks such as building and testing code changes.. Allowing developers to focus on writing code, helps to improve the efficiency and speed of software development, and ensure code changes are tested and deployed in a reliable and consistent manner.
